## Bio

<span class="image main">![](images/Cannyonlands2.png)</span>

My name is Fabien, around here I go by Kobol.  
I am a web developer and tech enthusiast. I currently reside in rainy Paris with my lovely wife.  
My academic education is in Business Management, I studied both in Marseille and abroad - London, Waterloo - Ontario. I have spent my early working years as an electronic music producer (I always enjoy having a conversation about that, so feel free to hit me up) then and I created two e-commerces with my wife, before becoming a web developer. All these experiences account for a large part in what I do, how I do it and who I am in general.  
Aside from the glow of my computer screen, I love soccer, Formula 1 and Mixed Martial Arts. I love listening to audio-books for the last couple of years, and I went through the whole Isaac Asimov Foundation series, Yuval Noah Harari collection, Stephen Hawkins and I just finished the fabulous Bad Blood by John Carreyrou. Lastly, I like beer and coffee.

### From...

At the dawn of the pandemic, my wife and I engaged in the journey of creating an e-commerce. Since I did not know how to write code back then, I decided to use Shopify. It was not the most original design for sure, but it worked well! I learned a lot about SEO and advertising with AdWords or Facebook.

### To:

<span class="image main"></span>

Slowly but surely my focus shifted towards how I could develop a better version of our websites. So I made the decision to fully commit to learning how to code.  
At the end of my training, I was ready to make the transition from Shopify to the infamous Wordpress (mainly because of SEO issues) and I was able to develop a complete theme from the ground up.  
The technologies I used were:

- The great [Roots.io](https://roots.io/) stack._ PHP._ Laravel Blade.\* Tailwind CSS.</article>

## About

<span class="image main">![](images/Cube3.png)</span>

I have a profound love for Arts and technologies; over the years I have learned to use software Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator, Audition, Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Blender 3D, Fusion 360 and the Office Pack . I also learned how to design and 3D print, and how to program and control CNC machines to produce prototypes.  
I have a passion for synthesizers and especially modular ones. This passion also brought me to my first encounter of programming languages - I then learned how to modify the Python script on my midi controllers - it also made me understand OOP programming quite easily later.  
Lastly, I'll add that I am eager to learn new technologies, acquire new competencies and meet new inspiring people.
