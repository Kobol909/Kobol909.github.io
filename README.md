# Curriculum vitae

## Professional experiences

### \- Developer of e-commerce on Wordpress | _2022_

#### Missions:

• I developed a theme from scratch, using TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, and Laravel Blade  
to design a fully responsive e-commerce.

• I chose the Roots.io stack for this project as it provides a better folder structure while enhancing  
security by limiting access to non-web files along with Bcrypt hashed passwords.

### \- Developer of e-commerce on Shopify | _2020 - 2022_

#### Missions:

• I designed and set up one e-commerce selling audio samples mainly to desktop clients, then a  
second one selling abstract art posters mainly to mobile clients.

• I managed to get both websites scoring an average of 90+ with Google Lighthouse.

• I was in charge of creating campaigns for Ad words and Meta - the average CTR went from  
1.8% to 4.6% for Ad words and 0.5% to 2.2% for Meta ads.

### \- Craftsman for The Fernande | _2017 - 2020_

#### Missions:

• I had the chance to conceive and set up an art workshop.

• I designed 3D models in Blender to test our projects - we were creating “infinite” art frames.

• My main role was to design 3D printed parts, I also programmed a CNC machine with Fusion 360.

### \- Electronic music producer / composer & DJ | _2013 - 2020_

### \- Booking agent | _2012 - 2013_

Managing director assistant, in charge of the tour management for several international artists  
(Avicii, Benny Benassi, Antoine Clamaran...)

## Education

### \- Self-taught web developer program | Udemy | _Sept 2021 - Feb 2022_

• I've enrolled in a dozen selected courses. My goal was to learn what was needed to be comfortable working  
with both front-end and back-end development.

• I've worked mostly with the MERN stack while creating different projects such as a food order web application,  
a social network clone, and a blog. I created a few REST APIs using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.

• I've handled file validation and sanitization both on the client-side and on the server.

• Lastly, I've managed user authentication and credential storage with passport.js and OAuth2 in conjunction with  
Bcrypt or Argon2 for better security.

• Had I had better hindsight on what I learned during this bootcamp, I'd have chosen to generate the back-end  
of my website as well as I feel confident in being able to do so.

### \- Kedge Business School | _2007 - 2012_

## Bio

![](images/Cannyonlands2.png)

My name is Fabien, around here I go by Kobol.  
I am a web developer and tech enthusiast. I currently reside in rainy Paris with my lovely wife.  
My academic education is in Business Management, I studied both in Marseille and abroad - London, Waterloo - Ontario. I have spent my early working years as an electronic music producer (I always enjoy having a conversation about that, so feel free to hit me up) then and I created two e-commerces with my wife, before becoming a web developer. All these experiences account for a large part in what I do, how I do it and who I am in general.  
Aside from the glow of my computer screen, I love soccer, Formula 1 and Mixed Martial Arts. I love listening to audio-books for the last couple of years, and I went through the whole Isaac Asimov Foundation series, Yuval Noah Harari collection, Stephen Hawkins and I just finished the fabulous Bad Blood by John Carreyrou. Lastly, I like beer and coffee.

## Work

### From...

At the dawn of the pandemic, my wife and I engaged in the journey of creating an e-commerce. Since I did not know how to write code back then, I decided to use Shopify. It was not the most original design for sure, but it worked well! I learned a lot about SEO and advertising with AdWords or Facebook.

### To:

Slowly but surely my focus shifted towards how I could develop a better version of our websites. So I made the decision to fully commit to learning how to code.  
At the end of my training, I was ready to make the transition from Shopify to the infamous Wordpress (mainly because of SEO issues) and I was able to develop a complete theme from the ground up.  
The technologies I used were:

- The great [Roots.io](https://roots.io/) stack.
- PHP 7.4 & 8.0.
- Laravel Blade.
- Alpine JS.
- Tailwind CSS.
- Kinsta.
- AWS S3.

## About

![](images/Cube3.png)

I have a profound love for Arts and technologies; over the years I have learned to use softwares like Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator, Audition, Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Blender 3D, Fusion 360 and the Office Pack . I also learned how to design and 3D print parts, and how to program and control CNC machines to produce prototypes and working products.  
I have a passion for synthesizers and especially modular ones. This passion also brought me to my first encounter of programming languages - I then learned how to modify the Python script on my midi controllers - it also made me understand OOP programming quite easily later.  
Lastly, I'll add that I am eager to learn new technologies, acquire new competencies and meet new inspiring people.
